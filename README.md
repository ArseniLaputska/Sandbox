## Sandbox
Here I'm always trying something new or using it for repeating.

Below you can see by topics what have done:

- [x] - ARC
    - [x] - How it works
    - [x] - Weak, unowned and strong references
    - [x] - Memory leaks
- [x] - Multithreading and GCD 
    - [x] - Methods: sync, async
    - [x] - Types: serial, concurrent
    - [x] - QoS: levels of priority
